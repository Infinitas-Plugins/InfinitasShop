### Selecting payment methods

Customers are able to set up their [shopping lists](/infinitas\_docs/Shop/shopping-carts) with pre defined payment methods. The method would automatically be selected when checking out. They would also have the option to change (and possibly save) the payment method before completeing their purchase.

### Configuring payment methods

From the [backend](/admin/shop/shop\_payment\_methods) the store owner is able to create and manage the various payment methods that are available in the store. Similar to the way [shipping options](/infinitas\_docs/Shop/shipping) can be configured, payment methods can also be made available to particular types of users and according to the cart total.

- Specify shipping options for logged in customers or guests specifically.

   Eg: Store owners could easily disable PayPal for guest customers.

- Specify a **minimum** or **maximum** cart total for payments

   Eg: Only allow 'cash' payments over $1,000.00 or 'PayPal' below $150.00

### Currency

All orders are processed in the stores default [currency](/infinitas\_docs/Shop/currencies).
