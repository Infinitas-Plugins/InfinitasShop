### Multiple branch stock

With the Infinitas Shop you are able to configure multiple [branches](/infinitas\_docs/Shop/branches). These brances are each able to hold different stock for each product variant.

Customers on the frontend will generally see the overall stock for all branches that are available. If you provide the option of `store pickup` customers would be able to find the nearest location that has the [products](/infinitas\_docs/Shop/products) in stock or request that the product be sent to a particular store if it was not in stock.

### Stock tracking by product variants

You are able to track your stock by product variants, for example if you have a `shirt` product you can track the stock of `small red` shirts and `large blue` shirts independently.

### Stock Manager

The stock manager allows adding and removing stock for existing products. Under normal circumstances, once stock has been entered there is no need to adjust stock manually. As sales come in, stock will automatically be deducted. Stock will also be automatically increased when making use of the `Purchase order` system.

Sometimes you may need to adjust stock manually, for example if you have `damaged` stock, or stock has been `stollen`. In this case using the stock manager to create manual entries makes sense.

### Adjusting stock

Once you have set the initial stock value you will not be able to change the value, instead you can add or remove stock through the stock manager. This is does so that there is a traceable history of stock levels and where stock came from or went to.

For example, if you moved stock from one branch to another instead of simply changing the stock count for each branch you would add a change of `-x` on the branch the stock came from and add a change of `+x` where the stock went. Overall you would still have the same stock, but a clear history of what has happened.

### Stock Valuation

You can generate reports of the stock value at hand, either `cost` or `selling` price. These reports can only be as accurate as the information within the system so it is important that entries are done accurately.
