### Multiple branch stock

With the Infinitas Shop you are able to configure multiple [branches](/infinitas\_docs/Shop/branches). These brances are each able to hold different stock. 

Customers on the frontend will generally see the overall stock for all branches that are available. If you provide the option of `store pickup` customers would be able to find the nearest location that has the [products](/infinitas\_docs/Shop/products) in stock or request that the product be sent to a particular store if it was not in stock.
