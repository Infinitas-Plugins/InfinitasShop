Categories are another way to group and categorise products. Each product can belong to one or more categories, but must be connected to at lease one active category for the product to be available in the frontend.

There are also fields in categories to create descriptions of the products that are found within that category.

- Options can be added per category.
- Options can be ignored per category.
- Options values can be ignored per category.
- Option values can be overridden per category
- Product types can be set for entire categories
- Categories can have an image attached from the ShopImage libriary
