### What is drop shipping

Some store are run using the [drop shipping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shipping) technique, in which the store owner does not keep physical stock. Instead as orders are placed the details for the customer are forwared to the supplier along with payment for the goods and the supplier completes the order.

### How does Infinitas Shop help

The Infinitas Shop has had drop shipping built into its core from the start. The entire system is designed to work with as little input as possible so that store owners are left with time to spend making money instead of managing an ecommerce platform.

From [automated purchase orders](/infinitas\_docs/Shop/purchase-orders), [mass updates](/infinitas\_docs/Libs/mass-actions) and [bulk imports](/infinitas\_docs/Shop/bulk-imports) everything about the Infinitas shop is designed for automation and ease.
