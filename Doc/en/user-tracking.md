To get your eCommerce store running as best it can you need to know what the users are doing and why carts are being abandoned (if any). Analytics provides this information and can be done through a number of ways. 

The Shop plugin already contains a lot of information such as what is being added to users carts, basic conversion rates and sales. Sometimes this may not be enough information and you will need to add some external service to provide this data.

> The normal route is to use [Google analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics), which is free but you have little control over the data and how it can be used. There are a number of other options such as [Piwik](http://piwik.org) which is completely free and open source.

#### Events

The Shop plugin makes use of events to notify tracking plugins of various data. Things such as when an item is added to the cart, or what custom variables to track such as the users currency.

This is all done in a flexible way that should be useable for almost all types of tracking.

#### Piwik

One [ready to use plugin](/infinitas\_docs/InfinitasPiwik) that is available integrates directly with [Piwik](http://piwik.org). This requires just a few simple configuration settings and you will be tracking all sorts of user metrics. The plugin even provides access to basic reports directly in the [backend](/admin/infinitas_piwik).
