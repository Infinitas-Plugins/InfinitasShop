Featured products are simply a way to make a product stand out more than another product. This allows Shop owners to highlight products that should have more attention than the other products in the Shop.

The featured products can be setup with a start and end date so that there is less management required. Configure a few products and forget about it. After the set times the product will no longer be featured.

#### Automation

With a few clicks the Shop plugin can automatically detect products that are good candidates for being featured. These include products with low views, low conversion rates and have not been featured before.

This makes it realy easy to keep a freash list of featured products with a minimum amount of input.
