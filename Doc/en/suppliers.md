### Using suppliers

Suppliers are used to track where you get products and services for your business. Its like a phone book of usefull information and can help simplyfy the day to day running of your business.

### Why track suppliers

You can enter all your suppliers details into the store which has a number of advantages. Firstly it provides easy ways to control your shop and its products. For example, if a supplier said there would be a `price increase` of 10% at some future date, you could easily update the prices for all those products with a few clicks.

Another advantage is for [drop shippers](/infinitas\_docs/Shop/drop-shipping). Sales can be converted into purchase orders more easily when the suppliers have been configured correcly. This will enable store owners to purchase stock mcuh more easily. It is also great for conventional shops that hold stock as you can still create purchase orders at the click of a button to replace stock that was sold.

Storing the suppleir details makes it easy to access information such as `email`, `phone` and `address` in one place.

Should you have some issue with getting products from a particular supplier or they close down, you can `disable` the supplier and all the products linked to that supplier will not be available to customers 
visting your store. This is great for store owners with 1000's of products who would rather not have to disable all those products indervidually.

### Not using suppliers

Althoug it is recomended to use suppliers correctly, if its really not for you there is a rather simple way out. You will need to create just a single supplier and use that as the supplier for all your products. Due to the way the shopping cart works there is no way to completely disable suppliers but this is a simple work around.

### Frontend 

Generally suppliers are not shown on the frontend and used internally through the backend only.
